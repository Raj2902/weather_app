Note :

1. I have'nt converted some of the manually written css to tailwind because i cant find its alternate in tailwind
   and some and css manually written is implemented for the dynamically created html elements.
2. I dont want tailwind base and tailwind components so i have commented them in input.css
   as it was colliding with the already written css.
